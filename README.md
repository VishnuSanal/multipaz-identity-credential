# Funke EUDI Wallet Prototype

This repository serves as a reference point for code used in the wallet prototype app submitted 
by the "Android German EUDI Open Source Wallet Prototype" team in the
[Funke competition](https://www.sprind.org/en/challenges/eudi-wallet-prototypes/). The exact source
code for our submission in each phase will be marked with a GitHub tag for easy reference, where the
application's code will be in the `wallet` module. 

The repository is a fork of the OpenWalletFoundation's 
[Identity Credential](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/identity-credential)
(OWF IC) project. The `upstream` branch directly matches OWF IC's `main` branch, and this
project's `main` branch is rebased on top of that with changes specific to the Funke competition.
